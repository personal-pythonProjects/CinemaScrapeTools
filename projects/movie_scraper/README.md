# Movie Scraper

This project is a part of the **CinemaScrapeTools** repository. The `movie_scraper` tool is designed to scrape movie lists from [SubsLikeScript](https://subslikescript.com/movies). It collects data such as movie titles, release years, and links to detailed pages, and stores them in a structured format (CSV).
